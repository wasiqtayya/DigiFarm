# DigiFarm

DigiFarm: The DigiFarm system is like a high-tech assistant for farmers. It's designed to make farming easier by using technology to keep track of everything happening on the farm. In the past, farmers had to rely on memory and paper records, which could be hard to manage. DigiFarm changes that by giving farmers a user-friendly app they can use on their computers or phones. This means even farmers in remote areas can use it since most people have phones nowadays.
